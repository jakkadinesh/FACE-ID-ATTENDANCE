# FACE-ID-ATTENDANCE
A smart and secure attendance system using real-time face recognition. This project leverages deep learning models (MTCNN + FaceNet) to identify individuals from live webcam feed and mark attendance accurately, eliminating the need for manual or card-based methods.

📌 Features
🎥 Real-time face detection using webcam
🧠 Face recognition powered by MTCNN (for detection) and FaceNet (for embedding)
📝 Attendance logging with timestamps and user identification
📸 Face image capturing for new users
🗃️ Embedding generation and storage
📊 Web interface built using Streamlit for easy interaction
🔄 Option for retraining model with new data
🧪 High accuracy with support for up to 1000 students
